# CUSSW: Cornell University Scientific Software Club

The purpose of the Cornell Scientific Software Club is to learn about
modern tools relevant for developing and deploying scientific codes.
Researchers from all areas of computational science and engineering
are welcome.  The planned meeting time is Mondays at 6 pm (location TBA),
starting on 2016-09-12 (the Monday after Labor Day).  We have a list of
[planned topics](notes/plans.md), but so far no specific schedule.

If you are interested in participating, please [let me know](mailto:bindel@cs.cornell.edu)!  This will help in making room
requests and planning requests to companies (e.g. for cloud computing
resources).
